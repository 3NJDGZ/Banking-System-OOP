# Banking-System-OOP
A simple Baking System with a few principles of OOP. Utilises Python, and CSV files to store the contents of the members within the database.

In this Banking System, you can create new accounts, create deposits, take money out, see bank details, and see user details, given the input of the name associated with the account as well as its passcode. There is no encryption used to encrypt the data. The only source of defense would be a simple passcode. All contents of the accounts can be seen through the given CSV (Comma Separated Values) file.
